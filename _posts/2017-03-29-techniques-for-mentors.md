Ask the Apprentice to Research a Topic
---

Ask the apprentice to research a topic you think they might benefit from knowing more about and write a blog post about it.

Ask them to research the pros and cons of a subject rather than just giving them the answer.

Review the Apprentice's Blog Posts
---

Review blog posts to make sure the topic is understood.  Ask for parts of the blog posts to be re-written if they are unclear.

Give Presentations on Interesting or Important Topics
---

Some examples of interesting topics are:

* SOLID
* Idempotency
* Database normalisation
* Four rules of simple design
* 10 laws of trust and 4 laws of consulting from 'The Secrets of Consulting' by Gerry Weinberg

Give the Apprentice Tasks Restricting Language Features
---

If you see an apprentice constantly using one language feature or design to complete multiple tasks, ask them to do a task without using that feature.

Review Application and Task Code
---

Review code for applications to try and discover areas that an apprentice could improve on, and patterns they could apply to improve thier code.

Some examples of extra tasks are:

* Learn some UNIX commands
* Factory patterns
* Composite pattern
* Pattern matching
* Definitions of test doubles
* Boxing/unboxing memory models
* Immutability
* Polymorphism
* Learning VIM commands
* Categorising slow running tests and running them separately
* Finding a bug using failing tests

Ask the Apprentice to Refactor or Rewrite Tasks and Applications
---

Ask the apprentices to refactor applications when and where appropriate.

Don't be afraid to ask for an application or code task to be completely re-written if the code is unrefactorable.

Pairing
---

Pair with the apprentice to enable them to see how you work and for you to be able to see how they work.

Do Some Fun Things with the Apprentices
---

Some examples of fun things are:

* Playing with Arduinos
* Micah Martin's Ant Game
* Whatever that game was were we had to respond to requests for pricing shopping baskets
* Communications training through improv comedy
