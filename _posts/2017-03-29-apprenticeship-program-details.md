Part of a series on [Apprenticeship Programs](/2017/03/29/apprenticeship-programs)

The apprenticeship program consists of a number of tasks that must be completed and applciations that must be written and then extended.

The applications must be written in a number of programs across program language paradigms.

All programs must be written using test driven development.  Programs will be reviewed by mentors who will guide an apprentice's progression and may ask apprentices to refactor or completely re-write tasks and applications.

Regular blog posts are required to be written almost every day.  Blog posts on technical topics that have been requested by mentors must be completed to the satisfaction of mentors who can ask posts, or parts of posts, to be rewritten until they are sure the apprentice understands the concept.

An apprentice will be asked to present themselves performing a kata, record a screencast of them performing a kata and give a presentation of a topic they have researched for their blog posts.

The apprentice will pass their apprenticeship if a panel of craftsmen are satisfied with the quality of their tasks, applications and blog posts.

Below are the tasks grouped by core concepts.  Some tasks appear more than once as they help to teach more than one core concept.
